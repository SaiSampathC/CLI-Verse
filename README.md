# 🌌 CLI-VERSE.sh

A hackerpunk terminal game for learning Linux and DevOps — one planet at a time.
Built with pure Bash. No Docker. No root. Just vibes and shell.

## 🚀 What is CLI-VERSE?
You're dropped into a broken digital galaxy.
Each planet is a real mission:

- 🌀 `git-labyrinth` → Recover lost files from Git history
- 🛸 `docktar` → Debug a corrupted Dockerfile (simulated)
- 🛡️ `firewall-x` → Fix a broken firewall config (simulated)
- 🕒 `cron-crater` → Repair a broken cronjob config
- 🔐 `perm-sigma` → Restore execute permissions to unlock the next stage

XP is earned per mission. Ranks:
- Shell Cadet → Kernel Operative → Root Architect → SysGod
