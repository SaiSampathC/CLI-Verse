## 🚀 What is CLI-VERSE?

You're dropped into a broken digital galaxy.  
Each planet is a real mission:

- 🌀 `git-labyrinth` → recover lost files from Git history
- 🛸 `docktar` → debug a corrupted Dockerfile (no Docker needed)
- 🛡️ `firewall-x` → fix a broken firewall config (simulated)

## 🎮 How to Play

```bash
git clone git@github.com:SaiSampathC/CLI-Verse.git
cd CLI-Verse
chmod +x cli-verse.sh
./cli-verse.sh
